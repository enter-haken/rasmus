# images and dot files 

This folder contains all images used in `readme.md` files.
It protects the source (sub)folders from pollution.

# build requirements

If you like to change the `dot` files, you have to install your [graphviz][graphviz] package for your system.
This requirement is optional, when you don't want to change the `dot` files.

# build

    $ make

will build all dot files
